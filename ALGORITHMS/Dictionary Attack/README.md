# Dictionary Attack

A dictionary attack is a method where the attacker uses a precompiled list of potential passwords, often called a 
"dictionary," to guess the correct one. This approach is more efficient than brute force because it focuses on common 
passwords or variations of them.

## Key factors

### Speed

It's faster than brute force because it tries only a limited set of words, making it more practical 
in real-world scenarios.

### Common Passwords

Many users choose weak or common passwords, making them vulnerable to this type of attack.
