# FAST AND SLOW POINTER CONCEPT

The "Fast and Slow Pointers" technique is a classic approach for solving problems in linked lists and arrays, 
often used in coding interviews.

## Concept

- A fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
- A slow pointer moves one step at a time.
- The relative speed of the two pointers helps solve various problems efficiently.

Common problems include:

- Detecting a cycle in a linked list.
- Finding the middle of a linked list.
- Checking if a linked list is a palindrome.
- Detecting duplicate elements in a circular array.

## Key Steps

- Visualization: Draw examples to understand how the fast and slow pointers interact.
- Edge Cases: Consider small or empty data structures.
- Debugging: Use print statements or a debugger to track pointer movements.

## Tips

- Start with simple problems like finding the middle of a linked list.
- Incrementally build up to more complex problems like circular arrays or palindromes.
- Time complexity is often 𝑂(𝑛) O(n) since each pointer traverses the structure only once.
