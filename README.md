# Data-algo-python
Useful data structure study and algorithms implemented with python, practing for technical interviews, live coding and leet problems

## Leet code best approach

- Two-pointer technique
- Sliding window
- Fast and slow pointers
- Tree traversal
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Binary search
- Dynamic programming

Solving 10-15 questions from each pattern (around 100) is enough to cover most interview questions. 

Start small, focus on one pattern at a time, and build your confidence.
