    "# Short coding session\n",
    "\n",
    "Todays topic is about Identity vs Equality\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, is vs ==\n",

    "## Step 1 - Code analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict results for the following codes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    c = a\n",

    "    x = 257\n",
    "    y = 257\n",

    "Case A\n",
    "\n",
    "x == y --> true always (same value)\n",

    "\n",
    "x == y --> still true\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 4 - Task answers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difference between is and == \n",
    "    - == asks: \"Do these two things have the same value/content?\"\n",
    "    - is asks: \"Are these literally the same object?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why integers behave differently\n",
    "    - Because Cpython may reuse (cache/intern) certain objects like small integers and some strings. That makes comparisons look consistent sometimes, but its not a guarantee you should rely on for logic.\n",

    "- One rule for when to use is\n",
