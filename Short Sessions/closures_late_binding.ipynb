    "The following code is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    funcs = []\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(3):\n",

    "        funcs.append(f)\n",
    "    \n",

    "```\n",

    "After running this code, the expected result wold naturally be : [0,1,2], but instead, it is [2,2,2]\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 2 - Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- Must keep a loop\n",
    "- must keep functions created inside the loop\n",
    "- May not use global variables\n",
    "- solve it in two different ways\n",

    "\n",
    "- What closure actually captures\n",
    "- difference between name binding and value binding\n",
    "- why python resolves variables at call time, not definition time\n",
    "- default arguments and function factoreis hange binding behavior"
